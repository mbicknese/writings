*Note:* This is a personal opinion / rant. It might not actually add business
value to you as a person.

As a father, husband and senior developer, time management is of the essence.
Time can only be spend once and I like to invest in all three subjects. Add the
rapid development of the JavaScript to the mix and you might find yourself
stressed out from time to time. But why are we talking about me, this article
is supposed to be a rant against "The professional clickbait".

Well let me explain. As a student, for example, you drink some beers; hang
around the campus; and read all those articles and try new frameworks. Because,
lets admit it, live as a student is pretty great and you got time to spare. Now
fast forward to the time you got kids and a decent job. You don't have time to
try all those funky JavaScript frameworks anymore. You pick one and hope for the
best.

It is kind of the same for picking blog posts or articles to read. My twitter
feed is cramped with "Why true developers use Nuxt", "How to combine XDebug,
PhpStorm and Docker!", etc. So I read them, update my knowledge and start using
my new learned skills in the real live.

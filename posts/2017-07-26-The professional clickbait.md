*Note: This is a personal opinion / rant. It might not actually add business
value to you as a person.*

As a father, husband and senior developer, time management is of the essence. Time can only be spend once and I like to invest in all three subjects. Add the rapid development of the JavaScript world to the mix and you might find yourself stressed out from time to time. But why are we talking about me, this article is supposed to be a rant against "The professional clickbait".

Well let me explain. As a student, for example, you drink some beers; hang around the campus; and read all those articles and try new frameworks. Because, lets admit it, live as a student is pretty great and you got time to spare. Now fast forward to the time you got kids and a decent job. You don't have time to try all those funky JavaScript frameworks anymore. You pick one and hope for the best.

It is kind of the same for picking blog posts or articles to read. My twitter feed is cramped with "Why true developers use [Nuxt][1]", "How to combine XDebug, PhpStorm and Docker!", etc. So I read them, update my knowledge and start using my new learned skills in the real live.

But more and more often I find myself reading an article, reaching the end and thinking: This hasn't thought me anything, at all! Short lame articles with interesting titles. Sounds familiar? The clickbait! But instead of the well known "What happened next, you'll never believe!", these titles look actually promising.

Just the other day there was this article about picking a good laptop for web development. The only possible interesting line in there was "You'll need 16GB of RAM with all the VMs we're using these days." [That's not what I want to give my fucks to][2]. The article was even concluded with "I don't want to give personal advice on which laptop to buy." Well, if you didn't want to go opinionated. Personally I thought that was a little late after giving his personal opinion on which elements are required for web development.

So please, fellow developers, write articles that truly contribute to the development world. So not like this one.

Thanks in advance,

Maarten

# Starting my very own blog.

So here I am, writing my very first article of my very first blog.

Not much to say just yet but keep an eye out for new articles. In the past I've
found myself researching subjects merely for the sake of updating my own
knowledge. Without noting down any of my conclusions or findings. This feels
like a waste, so hopefully I can save fellow gamers, programmers and fathers
some work by writing about what I do.

As I'm going to research some new subjects in the near feature, it felt right to
start a blog to begin with.

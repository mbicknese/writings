# About Me

My story starts back in 1994. As a 5 year old boy, I would start up my mothers
computer, open Word, and start making treasure maps using the Wingdings font.
About 7 years later the wondrous world of QBasic appeared to me, allowing me to
write my very first code. I loved creating text based adventures and modifying
the Gorillas game supplied with the editor/compiler. Sometimes I do miss that
bright blue screen.

Skip ahead to 2007 and we'll find me starting IT courses. During this time I
struggled with the enterprise aim of the courses. Combined with following
some management courses, I decided it was time to make a switch. So 2 years in
college I came back to my true passion: GameDesign & Development (GDD).

The adventure that followed was amazing. Quickly learning about Game engines,
3D modeling and game design (e.g. level and mechanic design). Although I kept my
focus on programming, I like to see myself as a generalist. What I want to do,
what I've always have done, is being able to either: to finish a product from
start to finish, or contribute to and understand all aspects of the product I'm
working on. This is what drives me, creating awesome applications!

During college...

*In summary:* I'm a home grown game and web developer. Loving to see
applications come to live. I can't stand bad UX, both virtual and in physical.
You can count on me being able to support the project from starting the first
designs to publishing it to the big mean world.  
**Warning** Do not put Maarten on prolonged production jobs, he will get sick and
may die.
